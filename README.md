An X and O game with advanced decision making algorithm, that makes the optimal move. 

The game, written in C, is based around the concept of X and O. There are 4 game modes:

    Player 1 vs Player 2
    Player 1 vs computer
    Computer vs Player 2
    Computer vs Computer

Note: You can toggle computer difficulty, 0 being "dumb" and 1 being "intelligent".

The AI maks a decision where to move, after determining the most optimal location.

The project is heavily focused on pointers, three dimensional arrays and memory allocation.
